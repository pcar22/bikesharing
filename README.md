# Bikesharing Challenge analysis

## Overview
This is an analysis of the bikeshare program in New York City. This analysis is to show that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa is a solid business proposal. One of the key stakeholders wanted to see a bike trip analysis showing customer types, peak usage times and other pertinent ridership information. 

## Results
### Checkout times for Users

The chart above shows a peak of 5 minute rides, with the majority of the rides between 2-16 minutes.

![Checkout Times by Gender](https://github.com/pcar22/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.png)

The chart above shows the greater checkouts are from the male population, however the times are in the same range. The unknown's or the population that did not share their information did not have the same peak usage.

The heatmap above examines ridership time by the day of the week. This shows peaks at what is considered the commuting hours and the weekend shows more riders around the middle of the day.

This heatmap breaks out per gender, showing the same patterns, however it is more distinct for the male riders.

The heatmap above shows the majority of the subscribers are Male, but both Male and Female increase ridership towards the end of the week.

This map is showing the top starting locations with the larger green circles indicating an increased quantity.

The map above indicates the a short travel distance.

The map above indicates the majority of riders are Male.

## Summary
The data indicates a possible target for profitable ridership, and that would be male commuters willing to subscribe to the service. We could do another visualization on the age of the ridership to confirm commuters versus tourists. One more visualization that could be done is for the number of times each bike was used and the total duration.
